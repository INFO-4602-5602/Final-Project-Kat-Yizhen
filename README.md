# What Are The Consequences of A Skewed Sex Ratio?
With the continuous expansion of the world’s total population, the per capita resources of our human beings are declining. In order to maintain social stability and rational distribution of resources, many countries have to introduce policies to control the population. Countries in Asia, northern Africa, and the Middle East have much higher ratio differences from male to female populations, due to the preference of birthing males as opposed to females. Because of this, it has led to an excess in males with no partner to find, and a number of “missing women.” This not only has social and cultural consequences on the man but the woman as well. We’re going to talk about how the data we collect can tell a story much bigger than the numbers. We are particularly focusing in on China, Yizhen’s homeland and a timely conundrum for the future of family lineages.
